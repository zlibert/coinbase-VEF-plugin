	|| Bitcoin Venezuela Coinbase's Plugin ||
	=========================================

A Chrome plugin that modifies Coinbase's dashboard and send funds web page to add market prices of bitcoin in VEF.

Purpose: to aid venezuelan users adoption and contribute with bitcoin massification.

Todo list:

0.- Plugin was made using the Desktop version of Coinbase. Responsive design wasn't considered. Plugin must be fixed to "survive" changes on tablets-mobile screensizes

1.- After clicking button to Send Funds, form modifications are lost due DOM changes, even hitting back. Confirmation amount should also contain VEF amount as primary.

2.- Implement ETH exchange rates

3.- Implement angular real time field binding instead of basic JS binding

4.- Check code: development was made and first working version was released. Code isn't optimized neither comes from an experienced front end developer. Also lack of financing makes it hard to release a "near perfection" version

5.- Transactions log in VEF isn't implemented

6.- When user adds VEF amount and it get's transformed to btc, it should also format the VEF input if the user didn't input decimal separator and two decimals
